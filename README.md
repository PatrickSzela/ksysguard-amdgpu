# AMDGPU Monitor for KSysGuard

Python 3 script that allows user to monitor AMD GPUs in KSysGuard (**AMDGPU driver only**)

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

### Features

-   calculates average values of every sensor (looking at you `gpu_busy_percent`)
-   supports multiple GPUs
-   doesn't require any special dependencies
-   no root needed
-   respects `Update interval` set in `Tab properties` in KSysGuard

**NOTE:** Some sensors require `amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xfffd7fff` boot parameter - [more info](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AMDGPU#Overclocking)

### Requirements

-   AMD GPU using AMDGPU driver
-   Python 3 (tested with 3.8)
-   read permission for files in `/sys/bus/pci/drivers/amdgpu/<PCI_SLOT>/*`

### Available sensors

| Sensor       | Unit |
| ------------ | ---- |
| GPU Usage    | %    |
| GPU Clock    | MHz  |
| GPU Voltage  | mV   |
| VRAM Usage   | MiB  |
| VRAM Clock   | MHz  |
| VRAM Voltage | mV   |
| GTT Usage    | MiB  |
| Temperature  | Â°C   |
| Power        | W    |
| Fan          | RPM  |
| Fan PWM      |      |

### Available arguments

| Argument  | Type  | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --tick    | float | Time (in sec) how often should the sensor data be collected                                                       |
| --logging | bool  | Enables logging - use when something isn't working. Do not use this argument when adding the script to KSysGuard! |

### Usage

After cloning the repository:

1. Add executable permission to `sensor.py` file
2. Open KSysGuard
3. Open `File` -> `Monitor Remote Machine...` and fill the window appropriately:
    1. Host: `AMDGPU` (or whatever you want)
    2. Connection type: `Custom command`
    3. Command: `<PATH TO sensor.py> [arguments]`

If everything went OK, new sensors should be available in the [Sensor Browser](https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/kde-workspace/ksysguard/the-workspace.html#the-sensor-browser). Then just grab the sensor from the list and drop it in a desired place.

_HINT:_ If the `Monitor Remote Machine...` is missing, create new tab.

### Issues

Project is still not finished and has only been fully tested on only one machine (Arch Linux, Linux 5.4, 1x RX 580, Python 3.8).

-   If you have a GPU from Vega 20 series, some sensors (or their min/max values) might be missing - with these GPUs the driver reports some data in a different way and I don't know (yet) how they should be parsed (check Issues if you would like to help!).
-   If a sensor is missing or its min or max values are `-1`, it means that the script failed to read a file - please read [Testing](#Testing) and include the output (with errors from `--logging` argument) when creating an Issue.

### Testing

It's possible to test the script manually by executing it in the terminal. If you do it with a `--logging` argument, you might see some errors get printed out after running it. Include them when creating an Issue!

Either way, the script now should print out:

```
ksysguardd 1.2.0
ksysguardd>
```

1. Type `monitors` to get list of all available monitors (in `CARD_ID/SENSOR type` format)

```
ksysguardd> monitors
0000:01:00.0/gpu_usage  integer
0000:01:00.0/gpu_clock  integer
[...]
```

2. Now type `CARD_ID/SENSOR?` to get info about a specific sensor - it should print out monitor info in a `name min max unit` format. This command is required for the one from next step to work!

```
ksysguardd> 0000:01:00.0/gpu_usage?
GPU Usage       0       100     %
```

3. Now type `CARD_ID/SENSOR` to get current value of the sensor

```
ksysguardd> 0000:01:00.0/gpu_usage
8
```

### TODO

-   Test with other GPUs
-   Add support for Vega 20 series ([Issue](https://github.com/PatrickSzela/ksysguard-amdgpu/issues/1))
-   Add support for Northbridge voltages ([Issue](https://github.com/PatrickSzela/ksysguard-amdgpu/issues/2))
-   Add sensors from Vega 10 and 20 series ([Issue](https://github.com/PatrickSzela/ksysguard-amdgpu/issues/3))
-   Add support for non-average values (as separate sensors)
-   Add support for multiple temperature sensors and fans
-   Add support for multiple hwmons
-   Improve performance and code quality (any pointers are welcome)
-   Add support for more units (if requested)
